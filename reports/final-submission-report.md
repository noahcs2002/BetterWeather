# Final Submission

My site can be visited [here](https://betterweathercsc425.netlify.app) and all
requested submission information, including my slides, ai-generated artwork,
final retrospective, etc can all be found in [my github
repository](https://github.com/noahcs2002/BetterWeather) in the
submission-components folder.

For the final sprint, I incorporated some final QA testing as well as
"stakeholder input" (I had a friend mess around in the app and give me feedback
on his thoughts).

Some changes include, but are not limited to:
- Added a loading delay to make sure the user can't overload NWS or GeoCoding
		APIs
- Changed the graph type for the precipitation graphs (from a scatter plot to a
		bar plot)
- Polished up some SCSS files to make final adjustments.
