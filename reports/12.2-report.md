## CRUD
CRUD, in an informal sense, is fully implemented in my app. I am leveraging a pre-existing APU in my app,
and so I don't have any formal use of the CRUD on my own.
We spoke about this, and you told me that it would be fine, and that my grade
wouldn't be impacted by this omission, since I have a special case application
anyway.
## How to Use
You have four options to use my site in its current state
- Local Development Server running the '*main*' branch
- Local Development Server running the '*prod*' branch
- Local Development Server running a *snapshot* branch.
- Viewing the site in the production environment

### Option One : Local Development Server Running Main
First, clone the repository found [here](https://github.com/noahcs2002/BetterWeather). The file tree should look like this:
```system
<previous_folders>
	| -> BetterWeather
		| -> .github/workflows
		| -> app
			| -> public
			| -> src
				| -> About
				| -> AdditionalInformation
				| -> Alert
				| ...
			...
			| .env
			| .gitignore
			| package-lock
		| -> submission-components
			| BetterWeather CSC425 Final Presentation.pdf
			| BetterWeather CSC425 Final Presentation.pptx
			| final_retro.MD
			| promo.png 
		| LICENSE.MD
		| README.MD
		| pull_request_template.MD
```
1. From your terminal or command line of choice, **c**hange **d**irectory (`cd`)
	 into the app folder. This most likely looks like `cd <where you cloned the
	 repo>/BetterWeather/app `

1. Run the command `npm i`. This will take the necessary depenencies documented
	 in the `package.json` and install them to the `node_modules` folder using the
	 version information provided in the `package-lock.json`.

1. When the previous command finishes, run the command `npm start`. This will
	 begin the development server and automatically open the app.

1. Use the application. It is fully development and should be good to go.

It is important to note that this is the version of the application that is most
up to date. The site is being deployed off of the `prod` branch, so some changes
in the production environment might not be reflected in this version.
### Option Two : Local Development Server Running Prod
Should you want to see what the production environment is running without
actually visiting the environment, then you can repeat the same steps as above,
However, after cloning the repository, you need to run `git checkout prod`. If
this command fails, run `git checkout -b prod`.

### Option Three : Snapshots

Throughout various stages in development, I created a *snapshot* for where the
application was at at that stage in development. To view the app at that stage,
you can clone the repository and then use `git checkout <snapshot branch name>`.
The existing snapshot branch names are 
- 1.3.0.snapshot
- 1.4.0.snapshot
- 1.5.0.snapshot
- 1.6.0.snapshot
- 1.7.0.snapshot
- 1.8.0.snapshot
- 1.9.0.snapshot

### Option Four: Production Environment

The site is live in a production environment
[here](https://betterweathercsc425.netlify.app). A direct link can be found in
[the Extra Information section](#extra-information).

## Work Done This Sprint
Some changes made this sprint are as follows:

- In a previous sprint, I toyed with the idea of changing the color scheme of
		the app around, as I didn't really like the blue-overload that was the
		existing scheme. I found a green and maroon style palette that I enjoyed,
		but I felt it didn't exactly fit the 'weather app' idea, so I changed it to
		another palette, and have decided to use that as my palette for the app.
- I hosted the app in a live environment, and split my CI and CD into two
		pipelines, GitHub Actions handling the CI and Netlify (my hosting solution)
		handling the CD.
- I converted the app's API system to a `.env` system. When constructing the app
		in a development environment, I could handle direct calls to the API.
		However, when the application is built out to an optimized production build
		using `npm run build` it disregards API calls being generated from a
		hard-coded string. I implemented a `.env` file with all my API URLs, API
		keys, and some meta-information like the version number. Then I configured
		the app to read from the environment file it is supplied at runtime, and
		that fixed all the loading issues.
- I created my slideshow for my presentation.
- I created a very terrible AI-generated poster for the project.
- I preformed my final retrospective.
- I produced version 1.9.0 and updated it in the GitHub repository.
- I implemented unit tests for all major components of my application, and
		integrated those tests in my CI/CD pipelines.
