## Mobile-Readiness Report 
As of right now, I have nothing left to add to the application to make it 
mobile ready. As of now, if you open the app on mobile, the charts scale to be more readable, and the navbar is scrollable to reach the quick links.

Had I known that this was going to be a mobile-centered app from the start, I would have likely chosen to make sure that I used a mobile-centered framework like ReactNativeJS as opposed to ReactJS.

As of now, BetterWeather is mobile ready.

## Optional Backlog Task
If the proverbial juice is worth the proverbial squeeze, I could condense the navbar into a hamburger or waffle menu, but at this point that would be a significant rewrite that I'm not sure one minor change warrants. I will consider.

Should that ticket be actualised, it is reported in my JIRA as:
